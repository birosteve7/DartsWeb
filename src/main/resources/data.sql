He broke from there by taking out 96 on two double 19s to make it 4-4 and hit a 62 checkout to hit the front from there at 5-4.
Ross Smith made it a decider from there but could not find his scoring boots which allowed the St Helens ace to ease through that final leg.
Dirk van Duijvenbode is also through to the next round to face Smith after a blistering display to see off an outside bet for many in Danny Noppert.
The Titan has not played since his World Grand Prix run but he picked off where he left off with a whitewash win with a 98 average allowing his opponent only two darts at double in the end.
Van Duijvenbode surged into a 3-0 lead in the early going with a break of throw leaving double 20 with 140 followed by 171. Noppert pressured but Van Duijvenbode put it away second dart in hand to take that break.
It was a double break as he went 4-0 up with a 14 darts outscoring Noppie with a 140 and 134 to leave 50 which he pinned to go towards the finishing line.

He soon trailed 6-5 with a brilliant 137 checkout after Clayton had hit a 180 but the latter held his throw to go 7-5 up and more missed darts at doubles saw Clayton lead 9-6 and go on the brink.

Like alluded to, Kleermaker was excellent to begin proceedings and headed into the first break 4-1 up pouncing on only 20% on the doubles at that point from Petersen.
